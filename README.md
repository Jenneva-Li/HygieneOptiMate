# HygieneOptiMate

The Hygiene OptiMate is an automated system designed to optimize user experience during hygiene-related tasks, including hand-washing, teeth-brushing, and face-washing while maintaining accessibility and usability for diverse individuals, regardless of age or ability. Features of the Hygiene OptiMate include an automated soap dispenser and faucet that has an ideal temperature and time frame preset for each task. This experience is optimized by allowing the user to complete these daily routines with a single swipe of the hand or click of a button. For individuals with specific preferences, the Hygiene OptiMate allows manual temperature adjustment with a simple hand wave motion. The Hygiene OptiMate not only simplifies these routines but also minimizes human touch, helping reduce the spread of germs in situations where multiple individuals may share the device. By making the laborious tasks of teeth brushing, hand washing, and face cleansing more efficient and enjoyable, a regular hygiene routine is encouraged, and overall health and wellness can be improved.
